# ReadBay

ReadBay is a kind of book reading management app with the central idea to make a mobile/web/desktop app which helps you schedule and keep track of online articles ,blogs and books you want to use. 
It will be built as a social networking app where people can see other's stuff (public profile) and also compete with each other like who reads more etc.
Since, this is an open source project so do suggest new features which we can add to the project along with these.

## Development stack

We will be building the web app in the MEAN stack which will be expanded to be MySQL, Expressjs, Node.js and Angular 8. 

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install all the required dependancies and then `ng serve -o` to serve the project on port number 4200.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Also, we will be building the desktop app and mobile apps too for the same so ideas are always welcome for them too.
